**Project Explanation:**

The project focuses on **automating data investigation and manipulation** for application datasets by creating a **scheduled, repeatable workflow** that operates without manual intervention. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

1. **Data Investigation of Application(s) Dataset:**  
   The project begins with a thorough analysis of the dataset(s) associated with one or more applications. This involves understanding the structure, quality, and relationships within the data to identify patterns, anomalies, or areas requiring manipulation.

2. **Creation of an Automated Workflow:**  
   A workflow is designed to perform a series of **data manipulation tasks** automatically. These tasks could include cleaning, transforming, filtering, or aggregating data to meet specific requirements. The workflow is built to ensure consistency and accuracy in data processing.

3. **Integration with APIs:**  
   The workflow leverages **APIs** to interact with the dataset(s) and perform manipulations programmatically. APIs enable seamless communication between systems, allowing the workflow to fetch, process, and update data without manual input.

4. **Elimination of Manual Intervention:**  
   By automating the entire process, the project removes the need for human interaction, reducing the risk of errors, saving time, and improving efficiency. The workflow is designed to run independently once set up.

5. **Scheduled and Repeatable Process:**  
   The workflow is configured to run on a **predefined schedule** (e.g., daily, weekly, or monthly), ensuring that data manipulations are performed consistently and timely. This repeatable process ensures reliability and scalability for ongoing data management needs.

**Overall Goal:**  
The project aims to streamline data handling for application datasets by creating a fully automated, API-driven workflow that operates on a schedule. This eliminates manual effort, ensures consistency, and enhances the efficiency of data processing tasks.
